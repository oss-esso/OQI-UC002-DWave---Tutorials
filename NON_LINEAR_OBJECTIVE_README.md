# Non-Linear Objective Implementation (A^0.548)

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates how to handle **non-linear objectives** in optimization problems where the relationship is not linear with respect to area. Instead of a linear objective `f(A) = A`, we use a power function `f(A) = A^0.548`.

## Problem Statement

In the original food optimization problem, the objective was linear:
```
Maximize: Î£ (weight Ã— attribute Ã— A_{farm,food})
```

In the non-linear version, we want:
```
Maximize: Î£ (weight Ã— attribute Ã— A_{farm,food}^0.548)
```

This represents **diminishing returns** as area increases - common in agricultural scenarios where efficiency decreases with scale.

## Challenge

Both **PuLP** (linear programming solver) and **D-Wave CQM** (constrained quadratic model) cannot directly handle arbitrary power functions like `A^0.548`:

- **PuLP**: Only supports linear and mixed-integer linear programming
- **D-Wave CQM**: Only supports quadratic (degree 2) terms

## Solution: Piecewise Linear Approximation

We approximate the non-linear function `f(A) = A^0.548` using a **piecewise linear function** with multiple breakpoints.

### How It Works

1. **Breakpoints**: Divide the domain [0, max_land] into segments using breakpoints
2. **Linear Segments**: Between each pair of breakpoints, use a linear approximation
3. **SOS2 Formulation**: Use Special Ordered Set of type 2 (SOS2) to ensure the solution lies on the piecewise linear curve

### Mathematical Formulation

For each area variable `A_{f,c}`, we introduce:

**Variables:**
- `Î»_i` for i = 0, 1, ..., n (lambda variables for each breakpoint)
- Each `Î»_i âˆˆ [0, 1]`

**Constraints:**
1. **Area definition**: `A_{f,c} = Î£ Î»_i Ã— breakpoint_i`
2. **Convexity**: `Î£ Î»_i = 1`
3. **SOS2** (implicit): At most 2 adjacent Î» values can be non-zero

**Objective:**
- Instead of using `A_{f,c}` directly, we use `f_approx = Î£ Î»_i Ã— f(breakpoint_i)`
- Where `f(x) = x^0.548`

## Results

### Test Run: Simple Scenario with 20 Breakpoints

**Configuration:**
- Farms: 3 (Farm1, Farm2, Farm3)
- Foods: 6 (Wheat, Corn, Rice, Soybeans, Potatoes, Apples)
- Power: 0.548
- Interior breakpoints: 20 (22 total including endpoints)

**CQM Statistics:**
- **Variables**: 432
  - 18 area variables (A_{f,c})
  - 18 binary variables (Y_{f,c})
  - 396 lambda variables (18 Ã— 22 breakpoints)
- **Constraints**: 75
  - 3 land availability
  - 36 piecewise approximation (18 Ã— 2)
  - 36 linking constraints

**Approximation Accuracy:**
- Max land = 50: Max error = 0.351, Avg error = 0.014
- Max land = 75: Max error = 0.438, Avg error = 0.017
- Max land = 100: Max error = 0.513, Avg error = 0.020

The approximation is very accurate with only ~0.5% maximum error for 20 breakpoints.

## Trade-offs

### Number of Breakpoints vs Accuracy

| Breakpoints | Variables | Max Error | Avg Error | Complexity |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 5 interior  | 162       | ~1.02     | ~0.13     | Low        |
| 10 interior | 252       | ~0.73     | ~0.05     | Medium     |
| 20 interior | 432       | ~0.51     | ~0.02     | High       |

**Recommendations:**
- **Small problems**: Use 20+ breakpoints for high accuracy
- **Large problems**: Use 5-10 breakpoints to keep variable count manageable
- **Production**: Balance accuracy vs solve time based on requirements

## Mathematical Background

### Why A^0.548?

The exponent 0.548 represents a **concave** production function (diminishing returns):
- For x < 1: f(x) > x (super-linear growth)
- For x > 1: f(x) < x (sub-linear growth)
- Derivative: f'(x) = 0.548 Ã— x^(-0.452) decreases as x increases

This is realistic for many agricultural scenarios where:
- Initial investments have high returns
- Returns decrease as scale increases
- Optimal allocation spreads resources across multiple crops

### Piecewise Linear Approximation Quality

For a function f(x) = x^p with p âˆˆ (0, 1):
- The function is **concave** and **continuous**
- Piecewise linear approximation provides a **lower bound** (underestimates)
- Error decreases as **O(1/nÂ²)** where n is the number of segments
- Uniform breakpoints are reasonable for concave functions

### SOS2 Constraint

The Special Ordered Set of type 2 (SOS2) constraint ensures:
- At most 2 consecutive Î» variables can be non-zero
- This maintains the piecewise linear structure
- Most solvers handle SOS2 efficiently with branch-and-bound

In our formulation, the SOS2 constraint is **implicit** through the combination of:
1. Convexity constraint: Î£Î»_i = 1
2. Area definition: A = Î£Î»_i Ã— breakpoint_i
3. Solver's handling of continuous variables in the piecewise structure

## Visualization

The `piecewise_approximation.py` script generates plots showing:
1. **Function Comparison**: True function vs piecewise approximation with breakpoints
2. **Error Analysis**: Absolute error over the domain with statistics

Example plots are saved as:
- `piecewise_approx.png` (10 interior points)
- `piecewise_approx_20pts.png` (20 interior points)
