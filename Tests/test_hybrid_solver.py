Test script for solving the food optimization problem with a CQM hybrid solver.

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Load a complex problem scenario.
2. Formulate the problem as a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM).
3. Use the LeapHybridCQMSampler to solve the CQM.
4. Print and interpret the results.
