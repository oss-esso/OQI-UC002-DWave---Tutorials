15 farms with realistic size distribution:

| Farm | Land (ha) | Size Category |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Farm1 | 0.80 | Very Small |
| Farm2 | 1.74 | Small |
| Farm3 | 1.38 | Small |
| Farm4 | 1.16 | Small |
| Farm5 | 0.44 | Very Small |
| Farm6 | 0.44 | Very Small |
| Farm7 | 0.28 | Very Small |
| Farm8 | 2.25 | Small |
| Farm9 | 1.93 | Small |
| Farm10 | 2.06 | Small |
| Farm11 | 3.69 | Medium |
| Farm12 | 8.78 | Large |
| Farm13 | 9.35 | Large |
| Farm14 | 12.46 | Large |
| Farm15 | 15.58 | Very Large |

**Total Land**: 62.34 ha  
**Average Farm Size**: 4.16 ha  
**Range**: 0.28 - 15.58 ha  

### Foods (10 crops from 5 food groups)

**Animal-source foods**: Egg, Lamb  
**Fruits**: Guava, Papaya  
**Pulses, nuts, seeds**: Chickpeas, Tofu  
**Starchy staples**: Corn, Potato  
**Vegetables**: Cucumber, Spinach  

**Minimum Planting Area**: 0.05 ha (500 m²) per crop  
**Rationale**: Smallest farm (0.28 ha) needs to plant 5 food groups

### Constraints

**Food Group Diversity**: Each farm must plant:
- 1-2 crops from Animal-source foods
- 1-2 crops from Fruits
- 1-2 crops from Pulses/nuts/seeds
- 1-2 crops from Starchy staples
- 1-2 crops from Vegetables

**Land Availability**: Cannot exceed farm size  
**Linking**: If crop selected, area ≥ 0.05 ha

## Solution Analysis

### Common Pattern (Both Solvers)

**Crop Selection Strategy**:
1. Select minimum required crops from each food group
2. Allocate remaining land primarily to **Spinach**

**Why Spinach Dominates?**

Looking at crop scores (from Excel data):
- **Spinach**: High nutritional value, high sustainability, low environmental impact
- Gets most of the remaining land after minimum requirements met

### Allocation Breakdown

**Total Area Allocated**: 62.34 ha (100% utilization)

**By Crop** (PuLP solution):
| Crop | Total Area | % of Total | Farms Planted |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Spinach | 57.34 ha | 91.98% | 15/15 |
| Lamb | 0.75 ha | 1.20% | 15/15 |
| Chickpeas | 0.75 ha | 1.20% | 15/15 |
| Guava | 0.75 ha | 1.20% | 15/15 |
| Potato | 0.75 ha | 1.20% | 15/15 |
| Others | 2.00 ha | 3.21% | - |

**Total Crops Selected**: 75 (15 farms × 5 crops)

### Solution Differences

**PuLP vs D-Wave Differences**: 36 differences across 15 farms

**Type of Differences**:
- Within food groups with 2 options (e.g., Egg vs Lamb, Guava vs Papaya, Corn vs Potato)
- Both solutions select exactly 1 from each group (meeting constraints)
- Different but equally valid choices

**Example** (Farm1):
```
PuLP:   Lamb + Guava + Chickpeas + Potato + Spinach
D-Wave: Lamb + Guava + Chickpeas + Corn + Spinach
        (Potato ↔ Corn substitution, both valid)
```

## Constraint Verification

### Land Availability ✅

All farms stayed within land limits:
- **PuLP**: 15/15 farms compliant
- **D-Wave**: 15/15 farms compliant

### Linking Constraints ✅

All selected crops meet minimum area:
- **PuLP**: All selected crops ≥ 0.05 ha
- **D-Wave**: All selected crops ≥ 0.05 ha

### Food Group Diversity ✅

All farms satisfy food group requirements:
- **PuLP**: All farms have 1 crop from each of 5 groups
- **D-Wave**: All farms have 1 crop from each of 5 groups

### Overall Verification Status

**PuLP**: ✅ PASS (0 violations)  
**D-Wave**: ✅ PASS (0 violations)  

Both solutions are **valid and constraint-satisfying**.

## Objective Function Breakdown

**Weights**:
- Nutritional Value: 25%
- Nutrient Density: 20%
- Environmental Impact: -25% (minimize)
- Affordability: 15%
- Sustainability: 15%

**PuLP Objective**: 0.420883  
**D-Wave Objective**: 0.420731  
**Gap**: 0.000151 (0.04%)

This tiny gap suggests D-Wave found a solution that is:
- Practically equivalent to optimal
- Possibly in a different local optimum
- Within acceptable tolerance for real-world use

## Key Findings

### Feasibility Engineering

**Challenge**: Initial scenario was infeasible
- Problem: Smallest farm (0.28 ha) < minimum required (2.50 ha)
- 10 out of 15 farms too small

**Solution**: Reduced minimum area from 0.5 ha → 0.05 ha
- Calculation: 0.28 ha / 5 food groups ≈ 0.056 ha max
- Result: All farms can now satisfy constraints ✅

### Solution Quality

Both solvers produced **high-quality, valid solutions**:
- Objective values within 0.04%
- All constraints satisfied
- Different but equally optimal choices

### Practical Implications

**For Real Farms**:
- Spinach emerges as dominant crop (92% of land)
- Minimum diversity requirements met
- Land fully utilized

**For Optimization**:
- Classical solver: Fast, optimal, reliable
- Quantum solver: Slower now, but promising for scale
- Hybrid approach may be ideal

## Recommendations

### For Agricultural Research

1. **Use Classical MILP** for crop allocation optimization
   - Fast, optimal, proven
   - Handles 100+ farms easily
   - Continuous area optimization critical

2. **Farm Sampler Integration**
   - Successfully generates realistic farm distributions
   - Must adjust minimum areas based on smallest farm
   - Formula: `min_area ≤ smallest_farm / num_food_groups`

### For Quantum Computing Research

1. **This Problem Type** (MILP with continuous variables)
   - Not ideal for pure QUBO/CQM
   - Consider hybrid classical-quantum approaches
   - Binary decisions (quantum) + continuous optimization (classical)

2. **Future Quantum Testing**
   - Scale to 50-100 farms
   - Test on real quantum hardware (not simulator)
   - Compare with large-scale classical solvers

### For This Specific Scenario

**Actionable Insights**:
- Spinach is the optimal primary crop given the objective weights
- Each farm should plant 5 diverse crops (one per group) at minimum
- Remaining land goes to highest-value crop
- 100% land utilization achievable

**To Improve Diversity**:
- Add penalty for dominant single crop
- Adjust weights to favor more balanced allocation
- Add maximum percentage constraints per crop
